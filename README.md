# Pokemon Pokedex Web Scraping Project
This project aims to scrape data from the Pokemon Pokedex website (https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all) using Python. The scraped data includes detailed information about each Pokemon, such as their name, types, abilities, stats, and more. The data is extracted using the pandas library for HTML parsing and is stored in a SQLite database (pokemon.db).
